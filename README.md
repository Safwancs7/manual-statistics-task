# Manual Statistics Task

## 📌 Objective
The purpose of this task is to create a small dataset of test scores and manually calculate the following statistical measures using standard formulas:

- Mean  
- Median  
- Variance  
- Standard Deviation  
- Probability of a score greater than 90  

All calculations were done manually on paper and compiled into a PDF.

## 📊 Dataset (13 Test Scores)
95, 88, 76, 92, 85, 67, 100, 83, 91, 78, 89, 94, 72

## 🧮 Final Calculated Results

### **Mean**
Mean ≈ 85.38

### **Median**
Median = 88

### **Variance (Population)**
Variance ≈ 87.7

### **Standard Deviation**
Standard Deviation ≈ 9.36

### **Probability (Score > 90)**
Scores > 90 = 5
Total Scores = 13
Probability = 5/13 ≈ 0.38 = 0.38 * 100 = 38 %
